## About
I am currently a Master of mathematics student.
Details:
- Full Name: Ori Bar-Gendel

## Maths Writings

Below is a list of my humble maths writings.
- Bachelor’s seminar on Lie algebras under the supervision of Dr. Gil Alon (in Hebrew): see [here](https://github.com/OriBarGendel/Bachelor-Seminar).
- Typed notes from courses I attended at the University of Bonn: see [here](https://github.com/OriBarGendel/maths-notes). *Use them at your own risk.*

## Education

2023 --- present: Master of Science in Mathematics at Universität Bonn.

2020 --- 2023: Bachelor of Science in Mathematics at the Open University of Israel.

## Hobbies

Playing the piano, reading books (mostly fantasy), writing poems and short stories, listening to music, and generally being curious. When I have the time I sometimes code, mostly in C and C++.

## Interests

In mathematics I am mostly interested in algebra, specifically representation theory and algebraic geometry. My Master's thesis, under the supervision of [Jens Eberhardt](https://jenseberhardt.com), is in the area of geometric representation theory. I plan to continue to a PhD in mathematics.

Apart from mathematics, I’m interested in linguistics, history, literature, programming, music, art, all living things… and pretty much everything else.

## Programming Projects

Below is a list of some programming projects I'm working on, or rather worked on. I will finish them at some point. I promise.

- Cyre (Private, In Progress):
	Cyre (Code Your Robot Easily) is a project I started back in 2020 that aims to give a simple interface to code a robot built on [Arduino Mega](https://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-mega-2560-rev3) (based on [ATmega2560](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/atmega2560)), together with a simulator (on Linux and Windows). When it finally gets to a minimal working state, I will of course make it open source, whenever that may be…

- Porting TEX to OpenVMS (Private, In Progress):
	Around July 2023 I decided to run [$\LaTeX$](https://www.latex-project.org) on [MicroVAX II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroVAX#MicroVAX_II) running [OpenVMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenVMS). It turns out that I need to port modern $\LaTeX$ to VAX/VMS 7.3 --- specifically this version, as this is the one that is installed on [TARZAN](http://microvax2.dynv6.net), my father's contraption.
	When I finish this I will of course make everything, including tutorials and an account of my journey, public.
    I got into VMS through my father, who is a MicroVAX collector --- you are welcome to visit his museum's [website](https://microvax2.org/wp/) or the aforementioned [TARZAN](http://microvax2.dynv6.net).
